# Accelerator! rules
A game to design particle accelerators

## Aim
Build the best and baddest particle accelerator on the block! Improve your accelerator to publish more papers, to get more users, and win more grants. 

### Setup
Each player completes each stage in turn before moving to the next stage.
1. Receives a starting grant of $100
2. Choose one source at no cost
3. Spend up to the total cost of the starting grant but any unspent funds are lost
4. Arrange their pieces into an accelerator structure

## Order of play
Each player completes each phase in turn before all players move to the next phase.

### Build phase
Each turn choose one of the following options:
* Buy a new component
* Buy and install a new component on an open end of your structure 
* Install a new component in the middle of your structure
* Move a component to a new position in your structure

### Publication phase
Receive papers based on:
* Accelerator tech development
* Results at experimental stations

Each paper-generating component lists the number of development papers generated on installation and number of papers generated per turn. Papers are drawn from the top of a face-down shuffled pile.

### Income phase
1. Earn fees based on user facilities (Add amounts listed on each installed user facility)
2. Receive grant money based on published papers (Add amounts listed on each current paper held)

### Assess victory points
Earn victory points based on:
* Papers published (gain victory point for each paper, then move paper to an archive pile)
* Prestige points (e.g. largest accelerator, highest energy accelerator, most user facilities, most publications)

### End of game
If any player has more than the threshold number of victory points, the player with the most victory points wins!

## Components

Each component costs an amount listed as C$# where the # represent the cost in millions of dollars.

has the following properties:
1. Development papers (earned once on installation)
2. Results papers (earned per turn)
3. User fees (earned per turn)

These are listed as D#/R#/F$# where the # indicates the number of development or results papers (D and R) or the amount of user fees (F$).
